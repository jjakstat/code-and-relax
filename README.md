Website made as a final project for the course "Grundlagen User Interface" in February 2022.

The goal of the project was to plan and realize an online presence for a given fictional company using a framework of choice.
The website had to be responsive for desktop and mobile devices.
The fictional company "code & relax" offers introductions as well as free and paid courses for esoteric programming languages (Esolangs) with the goal of achieving a relaxing, zen-like state while coding.
The final website was made using the UIkit Framework.
